    "1. Write a Python Program to Check if a Number is Positive, Negative or Zero?\n",
    "Ans:-Here, we have used the if...elif...else statement. We can do the same thing using nested if statements as follows.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Example:-\n",
    "num = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "if num > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"Positive number\")\n",
